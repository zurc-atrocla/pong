# Pong:

The simple arcade game remade in C with the SDL2 game library.

## Compiling:

The binary provided is compiled for x86\_64, and is dynamically linked with SDL2, so you need to install SDL2 first.  __Please note__ that this program was written for a Linux based operating system, so you'll need a distro with gcc installed to make this work.

## About this Code:

This is _not_ "production quality" code.  It was written over a three-day weekend a couple months ago.
